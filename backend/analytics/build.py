"""Compute the Insights page numbers from Neo4j and CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities list.

Run from backend/:  python -m analytics.build
Writes frontend/public/analytics.json (the page reads this static file, so it costs no API calls).

Fix-first score, 0 to 100, for every CVE:
    danger  = CVSS base score / 10                     how bad it is
    ease    = exploitability score / 3.9               how easy it is to attack (3.9 is the maximum)
    reach   = ATT&CK techniques reachable / 10, max 1  how far an attacker can go through the graph
    score   = 100 x danger x ease x (0.5 + 0.5 x reach)
Reach can raise the score by up to 2x but never zero it, because many CVEs have no CAPEC link yet.

Validation: CISA KEV lists bugs attackers really used. If the score is useful, KEV bugs should be
near the top of its ranking, more than when ranking by CVSS alone or at random.
